Any company would be lucky to have Reeka in a leadership recruitment team.Reeka is by far the best recruiter I ever worked with hands down. I had the pleasure of working with her for 3 years at Agoda and thanks to her we were able to dramatically improve our hiring pipeline. She is a hard worker, literally working non stop and she won’t leave any stone unturned to reach her hiring KPI. Reeka is very determined, data driven and goal oriented. Not only was she able to over achieve any of our expectations but she was able to do so while creating a unique relationship with the candidates that kept approaching her well after they were already working at Agoda. Any company would be lucky to have Reeka in a leadership recruitment team."',
