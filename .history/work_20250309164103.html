                                <p>"It was a pleasure working with Reeka through the recruitment process. I've never seen a senior tech recruiter that cares about their candidates as much as Reeka does. All the major and minor concerns of mine were covered and questions answered. She even volunteered to represent myself in the embassy of the relocation destination if need be.
